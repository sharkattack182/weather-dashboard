# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
As I continue my coding journey I am going back over each of my assignments from the bootcamp. The Weather Dashboard was one of the hardest projects for me to complete in the bootcamp. I remember feeling very overwhelmed dealing with all of the different languages being utilized at once. The API calls were so difficult for me to figure out. I recall desperately asking my classmates for help because I was so stuck. Since I have restarted my coursework again I have been looking forward to this homework assignment. I wanted to see how well prepared I was to slay my "White Whale".

## Process
This project was a major improvement for me this time around. I did a much better job this time around of fully understanding the material before attempting the project. With the fast pace of the bootcamp, I dont believe I fully had the chance to let the material marinate the first time around. I found the project much easier the second time. While I didnt render all of the elements dynamically, I take confidence in knowing I knew how to do so. Just for time and practicallity issues I didnt really see a reason to do so. One focus I have kept this time that I didnt fully understand the iportance of the first time was pertaining to the responsiveness of the app. My previous version had no responsiveness as I was only focused on the API call. As with all of my projects the second time around, this experience has really shown the growth I have achieved in the past few months. Its still crazy to think how I didnt even know what HTML was a little over six months ago.
